Neural networks come in various types, each suited to different kinds of problems and tasks. Here’s an overview of the main types:

### 1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**
- **Structure**: The most basic type of neural network where connections between nodes do not form cycles. Information moves in one direction—from input to output.
- **Use Cases**: Simple classification and regression tasks.
- **Example**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### 2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Structure**: Designed to process data with grid-like topology (e.g., images). They use convolutional layers that apply filters to detect local features and pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
- **Use Cases**: Image recognition, object detection, and visual tasks.
- **Example**: AlexNet, VGG, ResNet.

### 3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Structure**: Designed for sequential data. They have connections that form cycles, allowing them to maintain a 'memory' of previous inputs.
- **Use Cases**: Time series analysis, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
- **Example**: Vanilla RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

### 4. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
- **Structure**: Consists of two networks—a generator and a discriminator—that compete against each other. The generator creates fake data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data.
- **Use Cases**: Image generation, data augmentation, and style transfer.
- **Example**: DCGAN, StyleGAN, CycleGAN.

### 5. **Autoencoders**
- **Structure**: Neural networks used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for dimensionality reduction. They consist of an encoder that compresses the input and a decoder that reconstructs it.
- **Use Cases**: Data compression, denoising, and anomaly detection.
- **Example**: Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Denoising Autoencoder.

### 6. **Transformer Networks**
- **Structure**: Uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data. Unlike RNNs, transformers can handle long-range dependencies more effectively.
- **Use Cases**: Natural language processing, machine translation, and text generation.
- **Example**: BERT, GPT, T5.

### 7. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**
- **Structure**: Designed to work with graph-structured data. They can model relationships between nodes in a graph and learn from the topology of the graph.
- **Use Cases**: Social network analysis, recommendation systems, and molecular chemistry.
- **Example**: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs).

### 8. **Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs)**
- **Structure**: Uses radial basis functions as activation functions. They have an input layer, a hidden layer where RBFs are applied, and an output layer.
- **Use Cases**: Function approximation, classification, and regression tasks.
- **Example**: Gaussian RBF Networks.

### 9. **Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs)**
- **Structure**: Unsupervised learning networks used to produce low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data. They map input data to a lower-dimensional grid.
- **Use Cases**: Data visualization, clustering, and feature extraction.
- **Example**: Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map.

### 10. **Deep Belief Networks (DBNs)**
- **Structure**: Composed of multiple layers of stochastic, latent variables. They are generative models with layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) stacked on top of each other.
- **Use Cases**: Dimensionality reduction, pre-training for deep networks.
- **Example**: DBN for image recognition.

### 11. **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)**
- **Structure**: Treats the network’s forward pass as a differential equation solved by numerical integration. This approach allows for continuous-depth models.
- **Use Cases**: Time-series modeling, continuous data.
- **Example**: Neural ODEs for solving differential equations in continuous time.

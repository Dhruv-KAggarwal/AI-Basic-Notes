Great! Let’s start with **Lecture 1** on **Basic Data Structures**, focusing on **Arrays** and **Linked Lists**. This foundational knowledge is crucial as it underpins more complex structures and algorithms.

### **Lecture 1: Basic Data Structures**

#### **1. Arrays**

**Concept:**
- An array is a collection of elements identified by index or key. It’s a fixed-size data structure where each element is stored in contiguous memory locations.

**Key Operations:**
- **Declaration**: Define an array and allocate memory.
  ```java
  int[] arr = new int[10]; // Array of 10 integers
  ```
- **Initialization**: Assign values to array elements.
  ```java
  arr[0] = 5; // Assign 5 to the first element
  ```
- **Traversal**: Access each element using a loop.
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      System.out.println(arr[i]);
  }
  ```
- **Insertion**: Modify an element at a specific index.
  ```java
  arr[2] = 10; // Change the value of the third element to 10
  ```
- **Deletion**: To delete, set the element to a default value or shift elements (manual process).
  ```java
  arr[2] = 0; // Set the third element to 0
  ```

**Characteristics:**
- **Fixed Size**: Once defined, the size cannot change.
- **Efficient Access**: O(1) time complexity for access.
- **Memory Usage**: Memory is allocated contiguously.

**Use Cases:**
- Storing multiple items of the same type.
- Simple implementations where the size is known and fixed.

Yes, you can stop model training and resume it from the exact point where you left off. This is commonly done to save time, handle interruptions, or continue training on a different machine. Here's how you can achieve this in PyTorch:

### Steps to Stop and Resume Training

1. **Save Model and Optimizer States**
   - Save both the model's state dictionary and the optimizer's state dictionary. This ensures that you can resume training with the exact same settings.

2. **Save Training State (Optional)**
   - Optionally, save the current epoch and any other relevant training information (e.g., the random state for reproducibility).

3. **Resume Training**
   - Load the saved model and optimizer states.
   - Restore the training state if you saved it.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a detailed example illustrating how to stop and resume training:

#### 1. **Stopping and Saving State**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a model
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model, optimizer, and loss function
model = SimpleNN()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Define a dummy dataloader
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    [(torch.randn(10), torch.tensor(1)) for _ in range(100)],
    batch_size=10,
    shuffle=True
)

num_epochs = 5
start_epoch = 0

# Simulate training loop
for epoch in range(start_epoch, num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # Save model and optimizer states after every epoch (or at desired checkpoints)
    torch.save({
        'epoch': epoch + 1,
        'model_state_dict': model.state_dict(),
        'optimizer_state_dict': optimizer.state_dict(),
        'loss': loss.item(),
    }, 'checkpoint.pth')

    print(f"Epoch {epoch + 1} saved.")
```

#### 2. **Resuming Training**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the same model architecture
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = SimpleNN()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

# Load checkpoint
checkpoint = torch.load('checkpoint.pth')

# Restore model and optimizer states
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer_state_dict'])
start_epoch = checkpoint['epoch']
loss = checkpoint['loss']

# Define a dummy dataloader (same as before)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    [(torch.randn(10), torch.tensor(1)) for _ in range(100)],
    batch_size=10,
    shuffle=True
)

# Resume training
for epoch in range(start_epoch, num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch_idx, (data, target) in enumerate(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(data)
        loss = criterion(output, target)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    print(f"Resumed training at Epoch {epoch + 1}.")
```

### Additional Considerations

1. **Random States**: For full reproducibility, you might want to save and restore the random state of your data loader or any other sources of randomness.

2. **Saving Additional States**: If using a more complex setup, you might need to save additional states such as learning rate schedulers, custom metrics, or other configurations.

3. **Checkpoint Frequency**: Save checkpoints at regular intervals or after significant epochs to avoid losing too much progress in case of an interruption.

By following these steps, you can effectively stop and resume training from the exact point where you left off, ensuring continuity and saving computational resources.

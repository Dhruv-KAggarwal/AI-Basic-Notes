Certainly! Hereâ€™s a concise summary of Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization:

### **Batch Normalization (BN)**
- **Normalizes**: Activations across the mini-batch.
- **Advantages**: Speeds up training, reduces sensitivity to initialization, and can act as a regularizer.
- **Best For**: Large batch sizes and feedforward/convolutional networks.

### **Layer Normalization (LN)**
- **Normalizes**: Activations across features for each individual sample.
- **Advantages**: Works well with small or variable batch sizes and sequences.
- **Best For**: Small batch sizes, RNNs, and situations where batch size varies.


Here's how you can implement Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization in code using PyTorch.

### **Batch Normalization**

In PyTorch, Batch Normalization is implemented using `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d` for 2D convolutional layers or `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d` for fully connected layers. 

#### **Example with 2D Convolutions:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyCNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyCNN, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=32, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features=32)  # BatchNorm for 2D convolutions
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(in_features=32*28*28, out_features=10)  # Example fully connected layer

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.bn1(x)  # Apply Batch Normalization
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Example usage:
model = MyCNN()
input_tensor = torch.randn(16, 1, 28, 28)  # Batch of 16 images, 1 channel, 28x28 pixels
output = model(input_tensor)
```

### **Layer Normalization**

In PyTorch, Layer Normalization is implemented using `torch.nn.LayerNorm`. 

#### **Example with Fully Connected Layers:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MyMLP, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(in_features=784, out_features=512)
        self.ln1 = nn.LayerNorm(normalized_shape=512)  # LayerNorm for fully connected layers
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(in_features=512, out_features=10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.ln1(x)  # Apply Layer Normalization
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example usage:
model = MyMLP()
input_tensor = torch.randn(16, 784)  # Batch of 16 samples, 784 features each
output = model(input_tensor)
```

### **Summary**
- **Batch Normalization** (`nn.BatchNorm2d`, `nn.BatchNorm1d`) is used to normalize activations across the mini-batch and is typically applied after convolutional layers or linear layers.
- **Layer Normalization** (`nn.LayerNorm`) normalizes activations across the features of each individual sample and is useful for fully connected layers or sequence data.

You can choose between these normalization techniques based on your specific use case and the type of network you're building.

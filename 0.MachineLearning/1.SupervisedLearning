Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions. Here are some key algorithms:

### 1. Linear Regression
**Purpose**: Predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.

**How it works**:
- It models the relationship between the dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (X) using a linear equation.
- The equation can be written as: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n \)
- The goal is to find the coefficients (\(\beta\)) that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values.

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your features and labels
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 2. Logistic Regression
**Purpose**: Predict a binary outcome (0 or 1) based on one or more predictor variables.

**How it works**:
- It models the probability that a given input point belongs to a certain class.
- The equation is similar to linear regression but passed through a sigmoid function to output a probability.
- The equation can be written as: \( \text{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n \)

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your features and labels
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 3. Decision Trees
**Purpose**: Create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.

**How it works**:
- It splits the data into subsets based on the value of input features.
- Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and each branch represents the outcome of that decision.
- The process continues until the model reaches a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your features and labels
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### 4. Ensemble Methods
These methods combine the predictions of multiple base estimators to improve robustness over a single estimator.

#### a. Random Forests
**Purpose**: Improve the accuracy and robustness of decision trees by using multiple trees.

**How it works**:
- It builds multiple decision trees (a forest) and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
- Each tree is trained on a different random subset of the data.

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your features and labels
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

#### b. Gradient Boosting
**Purpose**: Create a strong predictive model by combining multiple weak models (typically decision trees).

**How it works**:
- It builds trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one.
- The model optimizes a loss function by adding trees that reduce the error.

**Example**:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

# Assuming X_train and y_train are your features and labels
model = GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Key Points
- **Linear Regression** is used for predicting continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression** is used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees** are used for both classification and regression, offering interpretability but can be prone to overfitting.
- **Ensemble Methods** like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting improve prediction performance by combining multiple models.

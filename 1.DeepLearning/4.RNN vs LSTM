Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks differ from standard Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in their ability to better handle long-term dependencies and mitigate issues like the vanishing gradient problem.
Here are the key differences and enhancements that LSTMs bring over standard RNNs:

1. Memory Mechanism
RNNs: 
Standard RNNs have a simple structure where the hidden state at each time step is a function of the previous hidden state and the current input. 
This means they have a limited capacity to retain information over long sequences because the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters
can diminish (vanish) or explode as they are backpropagated through many time steps.

LSTMs: 
LSTMs introduce a more complex structure with a cell state and three gates (input, forget, and output) to control the flow of information. .
The cell state acts as a long-term memory that can be read from, written to, and maintained across long sequences.

2. Handling Long-Term Dependencies
RNNs: 
Due to their simpler structure, RNNs often struggle with long-term dependencies. 
The gradients can become extremely small (vanish) or extremely large (explode) during backpropagation, making it difficult for the network to learn relationships over long time intervals.

LSTMs: 
The architecture of LSTMs, particularly the cell state and gating mechanisms, is specifically designed to mitigate these issues. 
The forget gate helps to reset the memory when necessary, and the input and output gates help to control the information flow, 
allowing LSTMs to maintain and access information over long sequences more effectively.

3. Training Stability and Performance
RNNs:
Training standard RNNs can be unstable due to the vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
As a result, they are less effective in capturing long-term dependencies and often require careful tuning and regularization techniques.

LSTMs: 
LSTMs provide a more stable training process by design. Their gating mechanisms help to preserve useful gradients, making it easier for the network to learn and retain information over long sequences. 
This stability often translates into better performance on tasks involving long-term dependencies, such as language modeling, time series prediction, and sequence-to-sequence learning.

Summary
RNNs: Simpler structure, prone to vanishing and exploding gradients, struggles with long-term dependencies.

LSTMs: More complex structure with cell states and gating mechanisms, designed to handle long-term dependencies, more stable training and better performance on tasks involving long sequences.
These enhancements make LSTMs a powerful tool for tasks that require understanding and retaining information over extended periods.

History of Github:

1. Local Version Control System(data is stored in local pc)(machine gone everything gone)
2. Centralised Version Control Sytem(centre machine and local machine)(central system gone everything gone)
3. Distributed Version Control System (Github like  stored in pc of all team mebers and in cloud server also)



1. Git
Definition: Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.
Features:
Local Control: Git operates on your local machine. You don't need the internet to work with Git since it keeps a local repository on your computer.
Branching: Git allows you to create branches to develop features in isolation and then merge them back into the main project.
Speed: Since everything happens locally, operations like committing and branching are super fast.
Use Case: Git is useful when you need to track changes in files, especially in coding projects. Itâ€™s widely used in software development.
2. GitHub
Definition: GitHub is a cloud-based platform built around Git that offers additional features for collaboration, code hosting, and project management.
Key Features:
Code Hosting: GitHub allows you to store your Git repositories in the cloud, making them accessible to collaborators or the public.
Collaboration Tools: It has features like pull requests, issues, code reviews, and project boards to facilitate team collaboration.
CI/CD: GitHub Actions allows you to automate tasks like testing, deployment, and continuous integration.
Open-Source Community: GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects, making it a popular hub for open-source development.
Use Case: GitHub is ideal for developers who want to host their Git repositories online and collaborate on projects with others.
